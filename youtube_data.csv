2025-04-08T01:54:47Z,@MusuemBucket,"Jokes aside, I’m honestly upset. Because the Tesla model y is actually a really beautiful car and teslas are just good in general. But it can’t be ignored that it’s owned by an unelected billionaire that’s probably a n@zi that just made this brand have a bad reputation. The only possible way people can buy Teslas again if it’s owned by a chill person"

2025-04-05T14:19:51Z,@KacperKitowski-z7t,"Very nice car 👍. The design of all TESLA car models should ,be consistent, futuristic, elegant. Only the composition and chemical proportions of the car batteries require refinement in order to obtain maximum efficiency and economy.<br><br>Standing ovation !<br><br>With respect,<br><br>Kacper Kitowski"

Tesla is making such a mistake making all their cars resemble the Cyber Truck"
